# Project Summary
In this project a user can sign up using a username, email and password then login using their email and password. While signed in they are allowed to make posts and see other posts and the username of whoever posted that post. A user may also choose to stay signed out, in that case the user may only SEE posts but, will not see who made the post and instead see "@???"

# Why I did this project
This project was my first step into working with authentication and authorization in a Ruby on Rails Project. I did it using the Devise gem.

# Running The Project
To run the project just ensure you have Rails installed then go to the directory and do 'rails server'
Then open your browser to http://localhost:3000/
